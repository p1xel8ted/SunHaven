Collection of SunHaven Mods

### General installation

Requires BepInEx 5 x64 (as Sun Haven is a 64-bit executable) installed into the "...\steamapps\common\Sun Haven" directory

https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/

If mods arent loading, check you have the correct version and architure installed (5 + x64)
Note, its architecture of the game, not of your operating system.

Extract zip archive directly into the "...\steamapps\common\Sun Haven" directory.

Config file can be found in "...\steamapps\common\Sun Haven\BepInEx\Config" after running
the game once with the mod installed. Can be edited in Notepad etc.

This configuration allows you to modify the CFG (in Notepad or something similar)

Some mods may require a restart of game after being disabled to revert any changes made.
